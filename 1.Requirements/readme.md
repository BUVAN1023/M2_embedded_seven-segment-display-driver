# INTRODUCTION #
- In this project we are going to design a simple Alarm clock using ATMEGA32 timers.
 ATmega32A microcontroller has a 16 bit timer,
 and we will be using that timer to count the seconds and develop a digital clock.
- All the digital clocks have a crystal inside of them which is the heart of clock. 
- This crystal not only present in clock but present in all computing real time systems. 
- This crystal generates clock pulses, which is needed for timing calculations. 
- Although there are some other ways to get clock pulses but for accuracy and higher frequency most prefer crystal based clock.
-  We are going to connect a crystal to ATMEGA32 for getting accurate clock.
